# zillaforge_floating_ip (Resource)

Manages floating IP addresses in ZillaForge. Allocates, updates, and releases public IPv4 addresses from a shared pool. Floating IPs can be associated with VPS instances for public internet access (association management is out of scope for this resource).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic Floating IP Allocation
# This example shows how to allocate a floating IP address from the shared pool.

resource "zillaforge_floating_ip" "basic" {
  # No additional attributes - allocates with default settings
  # The IP address will be automatically assigned from the pool
}

# Output the allocated IP address
output "floating_ip_address" {
  description = "The allocated floating IP address"
  value       = zillaforge_floating_ip.basic.ip_address
}

output "floating_ip_id" {
  description = "The unique ID of the floating IP"
  value       = zillaforge_floating_ip.basic.id
}

# Floating IP with Name and Description
# This example shows how to allocate a floating IP with metadata.

resource "zillaforge_floating_ip" "with_metadata" {
  name        = "web-server-public-ip"
  description = "Public IP address for the main web server"
}

# Output the metadata
output "floating_ip_with_metadata" {
  description = "Details of the floating IP with metadata"
  value = {
    id          = zillaforge_floating_ip.with_metadata.id
    name        = zillaforge_floating_ip.with_metadata.name
    description = zillaforge_floating_ip.with_metadata.description
    ip_address  = zillaforge_floating_ip.with_metadata.ip_address
    status      = zillaforge_floating_ip.with_metadata.status
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional description providing context about the floating IP's purpose or usage. Can be updated in-place without releasing the IP address.
- `name` (String) Human-readable name for the floating IP. Optional but recommended for identification in large deployments. Can be updated in-place without releasing the IP address.

### Read-Only

- `device_id` (String) ID of the VPS instance this floating IP is associated with. Null when unassociated. This field is read-only; association management is out of scope for this resource.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the floating IP (UUID format). Assigned by the API upon allocation.
- `ip_address` (String) The allocated IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 203.0.113.42). Assigned automatically from the pool during creation and cannot be changed.
- `status` (String) Current operational status of the floating IP. Possible values: `ACTIVE` (ready for use), `DOWN` (unreachable), `PENDING` (allocation in progress), `REJECTED` (allocation failed). All status values are informational only and do not block Terraform operations.
